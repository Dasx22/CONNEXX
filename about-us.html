    <div id="head2">Our Mission<br>
        <div id="body2">Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter 
                clean air, provide fresh <br>drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for 
                thousands of species of <br>plants and animals.

                Planting a billion trees can help save the Earth from climate change <br>and biodiversity 
                loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon <br>and support biodiversity.
                A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together.<br><br>
                So, we plant a tree for each transaction you make, thus, gradually approaching our goal.
